# ðŸ“Š Store & SKU Conversion Performance Analysis Dashboard

This project showcases a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize the conversion performance of various stores and SKUs (Stock Keeping Units). The goal is to uncover performance trends, identify top and underperforming entities, and derive actionable insights for business growth.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The dashboard provides a detailed analysis of:

- Store-level conversion rates.
- SKU-level conversion performance.
- Total revenue contribution by conversion rate.
- Comparative analysis of top and bottom performers.
- Interactive filtering based on Store ID and SKU ID.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- **Top-performing Stores**: Store_39 and Store_49 showed the highest average conversion rates across SKUs.
- **Underperforming Stores**: Store_12 and Store_30 had the lowest conversion rates, indicating potential areas for improvement.
- **High-performing SKUs**: SKU_11, SKU_7, and SKU_16 consistently achieved high conversion rates across stores.
- **Low-performing SKUs**: SKU_17 and SKU_8 underperformed, suggesting a need for further investigation.

---

## ðŸ§  Recommendations

- **Focus on Replicating Success**: Study strategies and practices in top-performing stores (e.g., Store_39) and apply them to underperforming stores.
- **Product Optimization**: Consider repositioning or improving low-performing SKUs like SKU_17 to boost their conversion rates.
- **Revenue Strategy**: Leverage the correlation between higher conversion rates and increased revenue to prioritize store-SKU combinations that drive growth.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** â€“ Data visualization and dashboard design.
- **SQL** â€“ Data extraction and transformation (via `appfor bharat.sql`).
- **Excel/CSV** â€“ Data pre-processing and storage.
- **DAX & Power Query** â€“ For calculations and dynamic filtering.

---

## ðŸ§¾ SQL File Usage

The file `appfor bharat.sql` was used to:
- Extract raw transaction and product data from a relational database.
- Join tables containing store, SKU, and conversion details.
- Apply filtering and aggregation logic before importing into Power BI.
- Ensure optimized and clean input for visual analysis.

This helped streamline the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for dashboard development.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Dynamic filtering by Store and SKU.
- Highlights top and bottom 5 stores/SKUs by conversion rate.
- Visualization of revenue trends across conversion rate bins.
- Summary KPIs for total revenue and average conversion rates.
